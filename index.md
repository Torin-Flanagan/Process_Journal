# Responsive Design and Technology Task 2 #
### Mobile Web App That Displays An Overview Of Key Components When Riding a Bike/Motorbike ###

## 1. Conceptualisation ##
### 1.1 Design Intent ###
As a summary, the design intent is to create an interactive application such as a web interface that displays an overview of the key components the API is obtaining from the user's phone such as the gyroscope, speed, etc while riding a bike or motorbike.

### 1.2 Research ###
Through using research of other similiar project found on the web, it has helped to gain a deeper understanding of what myself, Sean, and Jay are aiming to achieve for the project, along with how we are going to do so. Research found during this phase will greatly affect what we aim to create paired with each phase during development. This will include how we develop the web interface, how this interface communicates with the user's phone, and what informational components of the user's phone we are aiming to extract data from? The influence of this research will be seen more apparent later within this process journal.

**A Smart Wheelchair**

This project utilises a similiar concept as the concept we have devised ourselves. However, differences with the smart wheelchair incldue that the wheelchair iteslef comes with built-in sensors on the seat, collecting data every second in the background of the patient using the wheelchair. Data collected from this wheelchair then provides insight into the patient's seatin behaviours and the energy the patient requires in order to maintain correct posture. Another possible variation to this smart wheelchair could be to adapt fall detection so that the patient in the wheelchair knows when the wheelchair could possibly fall, giving time to call for assistance. These key features of the smart wheelchair then allow prople to monitor the patient from a remote location, or more realistically when they are out of reach from that patient. A Possible idea from this project that could be interpreted into ours is being able to remotely access the data obtained, no matter where you are.

### 1.2.2 Related Project 2 ###

**Road Sense**

![Alt text](./Images/Road%20Sense.gif)

The following project integrates a smartphone application designed to estimate road conditions using data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS. According to the research, machine learning techniques are applied to predict road quality based on this data. By leveraging the RoadSense app, the need for specialized vehicle sensors was eliminated, making the solution more scalable. The goal of the app is to provide users with real-time information on road conditions before they travel, potentially contributing to improved road infrastructure. The study highlights that combining data from the gyroscope and accelerometer proved to be the most effective approach, as these sensors can detect vehicle movements caused by potholes, rough surfaces, and other road irregularities. This insight is highly relevant to our project, as the accelerometer and gyroscope are effective in detecting sudden movements such as shakes, bumps, and tilts. These factors are essential characteristics of bike and motorbike usage, potentially making these sensors highly beneficial for advancing our project.
